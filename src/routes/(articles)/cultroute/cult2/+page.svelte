    The Serene Order is a cult that has gained attention for its unique focus on personal
    growth and optimization, as well as its love of internet culture and unity. The
    community was founded in 2015, on the principles of personal growth and

    spiritual development and communal living, with an emphasis on using
    technology to promote connection and growth. With over 10'000 members, their
    community is thriving and growing worldwide.

    The Serene Order is heavily influenced by internet culture, and members often use
    social media and online forums to share their experiences and connect with others.
    The group also offers a range of online courses and workshops focused on
    self-improvement, covering topics such as meditation, productivity, and mindfulness.
    Despite its focus on personal growth and unity, there have been concerns raised
    about the group's practices. Former members have reported feeling pressured to
    conform to the group's ideals and experiencing isolation from friends and family
    outside of the organisation.

    While the Serene Order's beliefs and practices may not be for everyone, it is
    important to approach the topic objectively and without judgement. The community's
    focus on personal growth and unity, as well as its use of technology and internet
    culture, may be appealing to those seeking a sense of community and purpose in the
    digital age.
