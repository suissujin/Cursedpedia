    Optimisation is the practice of making the best or most effective use of a situation or
    resource. There are several things that one can optimise, one of the most desired
    resources to optimise, is one self. Personal growth is the ultimate goal of many
    people, becoming who they really want to be, being proud of their actions and
    accomplishments. But distractions in day to day lives and negative circumstances
    make it hard to realise that goal.

    Being in a nonoptimal environment can have a big negative effect on one's personal
    growth. A bee would never be able to survive on its own, in an environment
    surrounded by birds. But when you put a bee in a hive, it has its optimal
    surroundings, being able to carry out its tasks and being with other bees that it can
    learn from and work together with.
