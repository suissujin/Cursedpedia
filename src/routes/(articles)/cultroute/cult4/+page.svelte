    A community is a social unit with communality like origin, likes, opinions, norms or
    religion. There are different types of communities like international-, virtual- or
    religious communities. The beliefs, spirit and motivation of communities and their
    members usually have the same origin. Communities support their members and
    stay strong, like a family. A community guards you like a shield and helps you. As
    long as you are a part of them, you will thrive with them. We want you to feel the best
    you can, as we all want the same. We want you to be the person you really want to be
    and <Link location="/cultroute/cult7" >attain your life goals</Link>, to free you from your hinderings in life. We want you to
    thrive with us, with the people you love, so you can love yourself.

    Studies have shown that people that live in supportive communities are 70% more
    likely to be successful and 80% less likely to develop symptoms of mental illnesses
    like depression.

    We, as the Serene Order, stand for fulfilling everyone's lives. I, Perimet and my
    daughter Annis, created this community to help people. There have been false <Link location="/cultroute/cult5" >accusations</Link> about scandalous actions that our community had supposedly taken,
    we are called a "cult" by certain people that hate us. These fake news are a hate
    crime against our community, and not tolerable, utter LIES.

    Although communities are very positive constructs, they potentially could also be used as a lure for lonely people to join cults or scams.
