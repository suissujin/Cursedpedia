  <p>
    We're not a cult. We just want you to get better. The amount of time you spent to get
    here already shows that you need us. We want you to thrive. We are a community
    with non-harmful beliefs, we just want to become great together to <Link location="/cultroute/cult7" >attain your life goals</Link>, so we can be who
    we all want to be, in unity.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know the people that don't want you to be great, the ones hindering your success,
    the ones making you feel like you're doing the wrong thing. We will free you from all
    that negative energy. You don't want to hear it but your family and friends don't want
    to see you win. We do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Loneliness is curable with a sense of community. Without community, what even are
    you? You're a bee surrounded by birds, join our hive so we can all see you thrive.
