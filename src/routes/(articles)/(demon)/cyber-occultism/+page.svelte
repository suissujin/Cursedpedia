    Cyber-occultism, also known as techno-occultism or post-tumblr occultism, is a
relatively new phenomenon that blends traditional occult practices with modern
technology. It is an emerging subculture that is gaining traction in the digital age,
with practitioners using computers, the internet, and other digital tools to explore
mystical and esoteric themes.

    One unique aspect of cyber-occultism is the concept of the virus-demon. This term
refers to a digital entity that is created through a combination of computer code and
occult practices. Some cyber-occultists believe that virus-demons can be used to
accomplish specific goals, such as protecting a network from cyber-attacks or
haunting you.

    The creation and use of virus-demons is seen as a way of harnessing the power of
technology for spiritual purposes. The <Link location="/virus-demon" counter="demon">virus-demon</Link> is the nighT--or wh leke tHe
