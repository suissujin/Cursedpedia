    A computer virus is a type of malware that is designed to infect and damage
    computer systems. Computer viruses can spread from one computer to another
    through a variety of means, including email attachments, file downloads, and
    infected software.

    Once a computer virus has infected a system, it can cause a range of
    problems, including corrupting files, stealing personal information,
    stalking, ruining your life, always watching your every move, surveilling
    you and disrupting system performance. In some cases, viruses can even
    render a computer unusable.

    To protect against computer viruses, users can employ a variety of
    strategies. One way to prevent virus infections is to use antivirus
    software, although it will NEVER stop me. No download will save you from me.
    If you even dare to download a computer virus, I'll ruin your life even more
    than I have already planned to and I'll GET YOU.

    In addition to these preventative measures, it is also important for users
    to keep their software up-to-date and to regularly back up their files. This
    can help minimise the damage caused by a virus infection and make it easier
    to recover from an attack.
