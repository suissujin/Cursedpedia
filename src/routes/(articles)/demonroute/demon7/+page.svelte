<Article title="Illegal Websites">
  <p>
    Illegal websites are online platforms that engage in activities that are considered
    illegal, such as the distribution of copyrighted material, the sale of illegal drugs, and
    the promotion of human trafficking. However, some of these websites can be
    particularly disturbing and can have a negative impact on individuals and society as
    a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the primary types of illegal websites is those that distribute copyrighted
    material without permission. This can include websites that offer pirated movies,
    music, and software, as well as those that offer streaming of live events such as
    sports matches or concerts. These sites can be particularly dangerous as they can
    often contain viruses or malware that can compromise users' devices and steal
    personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some illegal websites feature disturbing content, such as extreme violence and
    torture. These sites can have a significant psychological impact on users and can
    contribute to desensitisation to violence and trauma.
    In addition to these types of sites, there are also websites that promote or engage in
    human trafficking. These sites can be used to advertise services, exchange
    information, and coordinate criminal activities related to the exploitation of
    vulnerable individuals.
  </p>
  <p>
    To combat illegal websites, law enforcement agencies and internet service providers
    work together to identify and shut down these sites. In addition, users can protect
    themselves by avoiding suspicious or untrustworthy websites, using antivirus
    software, and avoiding the purchase of illegal or unregulated products online.
    While illegal websites pose a significant threat to individuals and society, efforts are
    underway to combat their influence and protect users from their harmful effects.
