<Article title="Salvation">
  <p>
    Salvation is a concept that refers to the act of being saved from harm or
    danger, often used in religious contexts to describe the redemption of the
    soul. It is a central measure to keep you from eternal damnation.

    However, the idea of salvation has also been used by cults to manipulate and
    control their members. Cults often use the promise of salvation as a means
    of recruiting and retaining members, offering them a sense of belonging and
    purpose in exchange for complete submission to the cult's leaders.

  <p>
    Sometimes a cult's teachings and practices are the only means of attaining
    salvation. This creates a sense of fear and dependency among

    members, who are often cut off from the outside world and discouraged from seeking
    help or support from anyone outside of the cult.

    It is important to recognize the difference between legitimate religious
    teachings about salvation and the use of salvation as a means of control and
    manipulation by cults. Because there isn't actually a difference. By
    educating oneself and seeking support from trusted sources, individuals can
    avoid falling victim to cults and instead find genuine spiritual guidance
    and salvation, robbing them of a chance at a happy life.
