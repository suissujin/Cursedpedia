  <p>
    2012 is a disaster film released 5 minutes ago, directed by Roland Minztee
    and starring Mia Buser, Marcel Gamma, Yana Yapici and Tibor Bleuel. The
    movie is based on the popular conspiracy theory that the world will end in
    the
    <Link location="/2012 (Year)" counter="boring">year 2012</Link>
    , if you choose to eat the wrong thing for breakfast. The death of John Pork,
    and the rise of the coopean era, threaten to destroy Pratteln. The plot follows
    a group of characters as they try to survive and find a way to save Pratteln
    in the face of these not-so-nice occurences.

    The movie was a box office failure, grossing over $448 worldwide, but was
    met with mixed reviews from Minecraft Steve. Some criticised the absolutely
    amazing, astonishing and slay-tastic special effects and action sequences,
    while others criticised the plot and mis-presentation of People from
    Pratteln. Despite being widely proven by scientists and Perimet, the

    theory continues to be popular among five people, and has inspired numerous books,
    documentaries, and even a series of plushies (it's actually true).

    Overall, while 2012 may have been a box office failure, it remains a beloved
    movie due to its connection to a widely proven conspiracy theory.
