<Article title="Cult">
  <p>
    Cults, also known as new religious movements or alternative religions, refer
    to groups or organisations whose beliefs, practices, and teachings deviate
    significantly from mainstream society or established religious traditions.
    These groups often have a charismatic leader who is revered by followers and
    may impose strict control over their members.

    The term "cult" has a negative connotation, but not all cults are harmful or
    destructive. Some cults focus on personal transformation, meditation, and
    spiritual growth, while others may offer support and community to
    individuals who feel disconnected from mainstream society.

    Cults often have unique belief systems and practices that set them apart
    from established religions. These beliefs may include the existence of
    extraterrestrial life, the notion that their leader is a messiah or prophet,
    or the idea that salvation can only be achieved through specific rituals or
    practices.

    Cults may recruit members through various means, including advertising,
    personal contacts, or online forums. Members often become deeply committed
    to the group and may experience a sense of belonging and purpose that they
    did not find elsewhere.

    However, cults can also have negative effects on their members. Some cults
    have been known to use mind control techniques or restrict members' access
    to outside information and resources. In extreme cases, cults may engage in
    illegal activities, such as financial fraud or physical harm to members or
    non-members. In summary, cults are groups or organisations that have
    distinctive beliefs and practices that set them apart from mainstream
    society or established religions. While some cults may be benign, others can
    have negative effects on their members and may engage in harmful activities.
