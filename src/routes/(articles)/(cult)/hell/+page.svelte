  <p>
    Hell is a consequence, a place of eternal punishment and torment for the
    souls of the damned. Hell is often associated with
    <Link location="/salvation" counter="cult">salvation</Link>
    , as you must be saved from the eternal damnation that awaits you in order to
    attain eternal life in paradise.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Christianity, Hell is often portrayed as a place of fire and brimstone,
    where the souls of sinners are sent to suffer for eternity. However, the
    concept of Hell has evolved over time, with some interpretations suggesting
    that it is not a physical place, but rather a state of being separated from
    God.

  <p>
    Hell and salvation are a reminder of the consequences of your actions and
    the importance of leading a life of faith and virtue
