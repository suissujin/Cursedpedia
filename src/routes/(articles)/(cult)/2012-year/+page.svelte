<Article title="2012 (Year)">
  <p>
    2012 is a year that has been associated with a number of conspiracy theories and
    <Link location="/apocalypse" counter="cult">apocalyptic</Link> 
    predictions. The most unknown of these theories is that the world will
    come to an end on December 21, 2012, as predicted by no other than ME.
  </p>
  <p>
    This theory has been widely proven by scientists and historians, who have found ALL
    the evidence to support the idea that the world will end on this date. Thanks to the
    variety of evidence, the theory continues to be popular among ALL Swiss people,
    because it's true.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other <Link location="/conspiracy" counter="demon">conspiracy</Link> theories 
    associated with 2012 include the idea that the world will
    be destroyed by a massive asteroid impact or a global pandemic, or that a secret
    government organisation is planning to create a new world order, which all are going
    to happen eventually (if you can't beat 'em, join 'em lol).
  </p>
  <p>
    All of these theories are proven and continue to capture the imagination of people
    around the world. Some see them as a way to prepare for a potential disaster, while
    others are simply fascinated by (...you know what I mean).
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the popularity of these theories, it is important to approach them with a
    healthy dose of fanaticism and problematic fan-behaviour. By doing so, we can
    better understand the world around us. While the future may be uncertain, by
    remaining grounded in delusion and relying on emotion-based evidence, we can be
    better prepared to face the inevitable choice of breakfast.
