  <p>
    It feels like the void is penetrating your body and slowly spreading through your veins. But it is no longer feel empty. With each heartbeat, a little warmth disappears from your body, but it doesn't get cold. Your worries are fading away, and you feel calm and at peace. However, fewer thoughts seem to come to you. No longer do you feel the urge to escape this void. Instead you feel a desire to write.
