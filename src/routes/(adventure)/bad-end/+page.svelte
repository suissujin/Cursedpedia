  <p>
    Perimet disappears. You advance further into the void in hopes of finding the light that guided you. But there is no light. Slowly you feel how everything starts to faide. Even if you go in the direction from which you think you just came, you cannot reverse this effect. The texture inside the void disappears, there are no more directions. There is only deeper. Time ceases to exist, your thoughts stop, feelings numb the only thing that still exists is you. Or do you?
