  <p>
    As you advance deeper into the void you feel how everything starts to faide. Even if you go in the direction from which you think you just came, you cannot reverse this effect. The texture inside the void disappears, there are no more directions. There is only deeper. Time ceases to exist, your thoughts stop, feelings numb the only thing that still exists is you. Or do you?
