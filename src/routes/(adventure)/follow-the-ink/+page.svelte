  <p>
    The light disappears and you step further into the void. The darkness around you may have no shape, but it seems to have a structure. A structure that moves, flows, like ink. Everything seems to be moving towards a point in the void. You included, although you cannot say if you are moving or being moved. And suddenly, something seems to manifest from this structure. It's not tangible, not describable, but it's present, and you feel the piercing gaze of this being.
