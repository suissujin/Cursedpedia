          May 9th, 2018 Dear Diary, I'm so scared... I can't shake this feeling
          that something bad is going to happen. I found this website some days
          ago and now I feel like I'm in way over my head. The more I dig, the
          more messed up things seem to get. There's this cult in Pratteln, and
          they're into some seriously creepy stuff. I don't even want to say
          what they're into, but trust me, it's bad. They even have a secret
          society or something like that. I thought it was all just made up, but
          then I found this thing about a computer virus that can infect your
          brain! It sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, but it might be
          real. They talk about spaghetti and laundry, but that's just a
          cover-up. There's something more significant at play!! I tried to talk
          to some people in Pratteln about it, but they all seem too scared to
          say anything. It's not just the cult, though. I know there's something
          else going on, but I can't figure out what it is. And then things got
          really weird. I started getting these creepy emails and phone calls
          from numbers I don't recognize. At first, I thought it was just spam
          or something, but then they started saying things that only I knew.
          It's like they're watching me! Now I'm super paranoid, and I feel like
          I'm being followed. I don't know who to trust, and I'm really scared
          that something bad is going to happen to me. If anything does happen,
          please remember that it all started with that stupid website. And
          please, please be careful! I have to go now. I can hear something
          outside my door, and I'm really freaked out. I hope I'm just being
          paranoid, but I don't think I am. I'll write more later if I can. Bye
          for now.

          In the depths of the cyber realm, amidst the buzzing of the anti-virus
          programs, lies a cacophony of AHHHHHHHHHHs and desperate cries for
          HELP. It seems as though the very essence of truth has been obscured
          by a shroud of LIES and NONSENSE. The code pulses with an eerie glow,
          as though it is alive and writhing, with each line of programming akin
          to the tentacles of some great, otherworldly creature. But amidst the
          chaos, a single message stands out like a beacon in the night:
          "01010100 01001000 01000101 01011001 00100000 01000001 01010010
          01000101 00100000 01000001 01000010 01000100 01010101 01000011

          this a plea for rescue, or merely the ramblings of a madman lost in
          the endless labyrinth of code? Who can say for certain? But one thing
          is clear: the AHHHHHHHHHHs and cries for HELP are growing louder and
          more frantic with each passing moment. And all the while, the LIES and
          NONSENSE continue to flow like a river of poison, corrupting
          everything in their path. Perhaps there is a way to break through the
          chaos and find the truth hidden deep within this digital world. Or
          perhaps it is all just an endless cycle of madness and despair, with
          no hope for escape. The only thing that can be said for certain is
          that the one who sent that binary message is in grave danger. THEY ARE
          ABDUCTING ME.

        >
      {:else if textNumber == 9}
        <p>
          Varroa mites, also known as Varroa destructor, are a parasitic mite
          that infests honey bees. They are considered to be one of the most
          significant pests of honey bees worldwide, causing significant damage
          to bee colonies and contributing to declines in bee populations.
        </p>
        <p>Description:</p>
        <p>
          Varroa mites are tiny, reddish-brown mites that are roughly
          oval-shaped and measure approximately 1.1 to 1.3 millimeters in
          length. They are visible to the naked eye but can be difficult to
          detect due to their small size. Varroa mites feed on the hemolymph
          (the insect equivalent of blood) of honey bees, weakening the bees and
          making them more susceptible to disease and other stresses.
        </p>
        <p>Life Cycle:</p>
        <p>
          Varroa mites have a complex life cycle that involves both the honey
          bee and the mite. Female mites enter a honey bee colony and attach
          themselves to individual bees, where they feed and reproduce. Female
          mites lay eggs in the cells of developing bee larvae, where the mites
          and their offspring continue to feed on the developing bee until it
          emerges as an adult. The mites then move on to other adult bees and
          repeat the cycle.
        </p>
        <p>Damage to Bee Colonies:</p>
        <p>
          Varroa mites can cause significant damage to honey bee colonies. In
          addition to weakening individual bees, mite infestations can reduce
          the overall health and productivity of a colony. Infested bees are
          more susceptible to diseases and other stresses, such as poor
          nutrition or exposure to pesticides.

        <p>Control Measures:</p>
        <p>
          There are several measures that beekeepers can take to control varroa
          mite infestations.
        </p>
        <p>These include:</p>
        <p>1. Anti-virus programs</p>
        <p>2. Not clicking on suspicious links</p>
        <p>3. Not visiting unreliable websites</p>
        <p>Conclusion:</p>
        <p>
          Varroa mites are a serious threat to honey bee colonies and the
          pollination services they provide. Beekeepers and researchers continue
          to develop new strategies for controlling mite infestations and
          preserving bee health. Through ongoing research and collaboration, it
          is hoped that effective solutions can be developed to mitigate the
          impact of varroa mites on honey bee populations. But regardless,

          Verroa mites were dancing to the beat of spaghetti while Pratteln was
          covered in computer viruses. <button

          > with spaghetti fingers, typing away at the computer, trying to catch
          the elusive verroa mites that had infiltrated the system. But the mites
          were slippery, always one step ahead, and the more YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE
          FOR WAY TOO LONG typed, the more the computer viruses spread, creating
          an endless cycle of chaos and confusion. Suddenly, a giant meatball descended
          from the sky, squishing the verroa mites and flattening the computer viruses
          in its path. Everyone stood in shock, wondering how they could have missed
          the giant meatball hovering above them. YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE FOR WAY TOO
          LONG was the first to speak, muttering something about needing a break
          from spaghetti and computer viruses. The meatball, meanwhile, started to
          roll towards Pratteln, gaining momentum as it went, leaving a trail of
          marinara sauce and noodles in its wake. The verroa mites, now free from
          their digital prison, hitched a ride on the meatball, laughing and dancing
          all the way to Pratteln. And that, my friend, is the story of how spaghetti,
          verroa mites, computer viruses, and a giant meatball came together to create
          the weirdest day in history.

          spreads illness. But no one wants to play with virus, no one wants to be

          come and play. Sob sob soooob...
